Most of work were done with colleagues from Bioinformatics Institute. 

- What causes antibiotic resistance?

Antibiotics are the main tool for treating bacterial infections nowadays. In our
research we studied whole-genome *E.coli* strain Illumina sequencing data to de-
termine its antibiotic resistance properties using bioinformatic methods. We explored
the genome of this strain and found 3 missense SNPs, one of which, apparently, is
responsible for the ampicillin resistance.

- Investigation of rare mutations that lead to epitope
change in influenza quasispecies population

Every autumn a seasonal —Åampaign to prevent mass influenza virus infection
starts. Each year people are vaccinated from several virus strains due to the high
influenza mutation speed. However even vaccinated people can be infected with
the flu if its strain is not covered by the vaccine. Another possible reason for that
could be mutations in one or several epitopes that make virions ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù for the
vaccine antibodies. In this research we analyzed the results of targeted single-end
deep sequencing of viral probes from person that was not vaccinated yet infected their
vaccinated friend with influenza. The main task of this research is to find common
and rare SNPs in Influenza A virus (A/USA/RVD1_H3/2011(H3N2)) segment 4
hemagglutinin (HA) of the experimental probe and to define whether these mutations
are in the epitope regions of HA. For this we set up a targeted deep sequencing
experiment to analyze the HA genes from the second person viral sample. We found
5 common mutations and 2 rare mutations. All common SNPs and one of rare SNPs
were synonymous. Another rare SNP (307 position, C -> T, frequency 0.94%) was
a missense variant (Pro -> Ser) that belongs to the Epitope D segment of viral
hemagglutinin. We conclude that due to the high mutation speed part of the viral
population acquired the SNP that changed the Epitope D of viral hemagglutinin
protein and thus became contageous even for the vaccinated person. The moral of
the story is notorious: every non-vaccinated person gives a perfect opportunity for
viruses to evolve and adapt to recent vaccines.

- *E.coli* outbreak investigation

We investigate a reason of Europe outbreak in 2011 of hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), a disease that often starts as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and can
lead to kidney failure. We know that the cause was the new strain of *E. coli*, so
we assemble the genome of unknown strain *de novo* to find why people had HUS.
We annotated the assembly, identified the closest relative of unknown *E. coli* strain
and found that investigated strain has *stxA* and *stxB* genes. These genes produce
Shiga-toxin, that could be the cause of HUS. Also we found out that this strain
is resistant to many clases of antibiotics, including beta-lactam, tetracycline, folate
pathway antagonist, aminoglycoside, quaternary ammonium compound, so it can be
the cause of outbreak

- Tardigrades: from genestealers to space marines

A tiny water bear with eight legs and covered in tough cales, which can endure
conditions that don‚Äôt even exist on Earth, such as vacuum, absolute zero and ùõæ-
radiation at doses between 1.0 ‚Äì 9.0 kGy, is a tardigrade. Their extreme tolerance
raise from the ability to dry without critical DNA damage, unlike other animals.
The nature of preventing DNA distruction could unveil new DNA protection mech-
anism. Here we analysed tandem mass spectrometry data obtained from isolated
chromatin fraction of Ramazzottius varieornatus to understand how tardigrades‚Äô
DNA is keeping from radiation-induced damages. We find 5 proteins that can pro-
vide this protection function, and one of them is already described in Ramazzottius
varieornatus as Damage suppressor protein (Dsup).

- How to build a perfect professor (instruction for beginners)

This work is performed in consistency with the main postulates of tran-shumanism
and the Earth Planet Transhumanism Party(EPTP). The
main goals of EPTP are protection from unhealthy habits, enlargement
of life quality and longevity. Using genome sequencing technologies we
found five pathogenic-like SNPs and five loci with potential for improve-
ment in the genome of patient M.R. We have changed clinically dangerous
SNPs: rs4961, rs3780422, rs7034200, rs10974944, rs755383 for the neutral
alleles. It will decrease the risk of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
myeloproliferative neoplasms, testicular cancer and nicotine addiction.
We added SNPs rs6046, rs5355, rs7412, rs10989591. They are responsible
for improving memory skills in older age and decreasing the probabil-
ity of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and arterial hypertension. We also realised
another part of the EPTP - collecting genealogical data about all citi-
zens. We detected, our patient‚Äôs haplogroup is R1a1a, distributed from
Scandinavia and Central Europe to southern Siberia and South Asia.

- Differential analysis of RNA expression during fermentation in yeast

The RNA-Seq technique analyses quickly and cheaply the number of RNAs thus allowing to describe
of the pool of transcribing genes in a sample. Yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae could not only
obtain energy via aerobic respiration but also switch to fermentation in an anaerobic environment. During
this shift, the majority of enzymes involved in translation and carbohydrate metabolism (especially for
anaerobic pathways) increase their translation. Whereas other enzymes, for example, PCK1 that launches
gluconeogenesis, reduce in amount probably due to the irrelevancy of glucose storing.
